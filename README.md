# Disease-Progression-Simulation
A python based Disease Progression Simulation program that maps the routines of people in a town and sohws how disease spreads from one person to the other. Each node has a predefined age at the time of initialization and has a certian routine to follow. There is also deadlock logic to ensure that it resembles how precautions are taken when number of diseased people cross a certain threshold.
